This is to control the flow of PLANES at an AIRPORT. 
Planes can take off when the WEATHER is SUNNY but not when its STORMY.

Create a set of classes and modules to pass the test suite at http://bit.ly/1dFD7f1

A RANDOM NUMBER generator will be needed to set the weather. 

Use a double to override random weather. 

Every plane must have a status stating if its FLYING or LANDED. 

This project uses Rspec, Ruby and TDD, some pair programming was involved, though the project was completed alone over the weekend. 

Some notes from tutor left regarding test error as reminders in TDD process.
