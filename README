This is to control the flow of PLANES at an AIRPORT. 
Planes can take off when the WEATHER is SUNNY but not when its STORMY.

Create a set of classes and modules to pass the test suite at http://bit.ly/1dFD7f1

A RANDOM NUMBER generator will be needed to set the weather. 

Use a double to override random weather. 

Every plane must have a status stating if its FLYING or LANDED.
